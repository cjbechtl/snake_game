# snake_game
classic snake game built using JavaScript

no JS libraries were used as this was more of a test to see if I could do it from scratch.

open index.html or visit: https://cjbechtl.github.io/snake_game/ to start the game.

You can use the arrow keys, "wasd", or "hjkl" to control the snake.
